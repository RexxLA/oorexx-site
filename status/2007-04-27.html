<h1>Open Object Rexx Project Status<br />
April - 2007</h1>
</center>

<h2>Web Site</h2>
<p>The web site has been successfully moved to the RICE server at Safe Data, Inc.
This allows for a single server to host both the ooRexx web site and the
RexxLA website. This server also hosts the RexxLA mailing lists.</p>
<p>As of April 27 there had been 31541 visitors to the ooRexx website. This averages
to 143 visitors per day.</p>


<h2>General</h2>
<p>As of Apri 23 Open Object Rexx 3.1.2 is generally available.
We have received a large number of downloads for ooRexx and are very pleased
with the reception by the community.</p>
<p>We added some new platforms for ooRexx with the 3.1.2 release including the
PPC platform and Debian Linux distributions. Windows Vista is also now
supported. </p>


<h2>Interpreter Status</h2>

<p>Many thanks to Mark Miesfeld for fixing numerous bugs in the Windows version
of ooRexx. He also fixed a number of bugs/problems with ooDialog.
All of his fixes were included in the 3.1.2 release. This should fix
most of the outstanding issues with the Windows version of ooRexx.</p>
<p>A really bad memory management bug was also fixed in the Unix/Linux version
of ooRexx. It caused a segmentation fault on some large ooRexx programs.</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Version 3.1.2 of the documentation is available. This
update corresponds to the ooRexx 3.1.2 release.</p>


<h2>Project Administration</h2>

<p>David Ashley will be taking on more project management tasks from Mark
Hessling as soon as the RexxLA board approves the action. Mark will be
taking over David's project administration position.</p>


<h2>Related News</h2>

<p>Work has already started on the ooRexx 3.2 release. This will include a
number of language enhancements thanks to Rick McGuire.</p>
<p>Work is also proceeding with the future 4.0 release, although at a slow pace.
There is still no projected date for this release but progress is being made.</p>
