<h2>Web Site</h2>
<p>The new <a href="http://www.oorexx.org">ooRexx Web Site</a> has been built, and the ooRexx domains;
oorexx.org, oorexx.net, oorexx.com and oorexx.info now point there.</p>

<h2>Interpreter Status</h2>

<p>After a lot of really good work by the project team we have finally released
Version 3.0.0 of Open Object Rexx. You can download the source and binaries for
all the supported platforms
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=119701">here</a>.
Due to a lack of resources we were not able to complete the AIX port.
The Windows binary version includes the PDF documentation but all other
platforms will have to download the documentation seperately.</p>

<p>The source for Open Object Rexx is now publicly available and the
SourceForge CVS repository is now active.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The Version 3.0.0 documentation is available to download at the location
