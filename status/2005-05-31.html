<h1>Open Object Rexx Project Status<br />
May - 2005</h1>
</center>

<h2>Web Site</h2>
<p>The new <a href="http://www.oorexx.org">ooRexx Web Site</a> has been built,
and the ooRexx domains:
oorexx.org, oorexx.net, oorexx.com and oorexx.info now point there.</p>


<h2>Interpreter Status</h2>

<p>A small bug in the installation program for the Windows version
of ooRexx Version 3.0.0 was reported. A new Version 3.0.1 is available which
fixes the bug. The new version is available
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=119701">here</a>.
</p>

<p>There have been over 12,000 downloads of the Version 3.0.x release since it
was made available in March. This puts the ooRexx Project in the top 1% of all
projects on the SourceForge site. Needless to say, the development team is
very pleased with this and we expect that even better things will happen in the
future.</p>

<p>Rick has started to perform the 64-bit cleanup of the code. This will involve
some major updates to the Rexx API and some other features. We do not have a
timeframe for completion of this work.</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>A new Version 3.0.0 Revision 1 of the documentation is available. This is a
small update that adds PDF Summary Information to each PDF and fixes a few
formating problems.
</p>

<p>We are working on adding indexes to each PDF. This will take some time and
we do not expect a release of the documentation that includes indexes to be
available until sometime in July.</p>


<h2>Project Administration</h2>

<p>The proposed <a href="http://www.oorexx.org/charter.html">Project Charter</a> has been
adopted by the Rexx Language Association.</p>

<p>Initial roles for the current project team have been defined. Who is doing what
can be seen on the <a href="http://www.oorexx.org/contact.html">ooRexx Contacts</a> page.
</p>


<h2>Other</h2>
<p>As always you can subscribe to the
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/oorexx-announce">oorexx-announce</a>
mailing list to receive development updates and news like this.</p>
