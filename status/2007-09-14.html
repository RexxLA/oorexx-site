<h1>Open Object Rexx Project Status<br />
September - 2007</h1>
</center>

<h2>Web Site</h2>
<p>As of September 13 there had been 53940 visitors to the ooRexx website.
This averages to 150 visitors per day.</p>
<p>The ooRexx Build machine website is now up and operational.
It currently supports four operating system - Windows 2000, Windows XP,
Ubuntu 7.04 and Fedora 7. Anyone can now request a build of the current
Subversion HEAD of the interpreter and the docs. This is currently will be a
prerelease test/development version of 3.2.0.</p>


<h2>General</h2>

<p>Currently we are planning the release of ooRexx 3.2.0 at the end of October.
This is a very large upgrade of the software and documentation so everyone
should be prepared for a lot of new features to be made with this release.</p>


<h2>Interpreter Status</h2>

<p>The 3.2.0 interpreter is now stable. A lot of new classes have been added
and the existing classes have been reorganized. Mark Miesfeld has done
some great work on ooDialog and provided some new samples and made it easier
to work with.</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The documentation of all the ooRexx classes in the reference manual has been
completely reorganized and updated. A review of the documentation is now under
way and should be completed by the end of September.</p?


<h2>Project Administration</h2>

<p>We have added two new members to the development team. Mark Weaver and
Terry Constant. Both of these new developers will concentrate on getting the
ooRexx wiki organized and updated.</p>


<h2>Related News</h2>

<p>Work is still proceeding with the future 4.0 release, although at a slow pace.
There is still no projected date for this release but progress is being made.</p>
