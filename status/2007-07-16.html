<h1>Open Object Rexx Project Status<br />
July - 2007</h1>
</center>

<h2>Web Site</h2>
<p>As of April 27 there had been 45349 visitors to the ooRexx website. This averages
to 151 visitors per day.</p>
<p>The ooRexx Build machine website is now up and at least partially operational.
It is still not able to produce automated builds yet due to an API problem
with VMware and Linux guest operating systems. We are still working through
that problem, but the site does now host copies of the manual builds the team
is producing.</p>


<h2>General</h2>

<p>As of Apri 23 Open Object Rexx 3.1.2 is generally available.
We have received a large number of downloads for ooRexx and are very pleased
with the reception by the community.</p>
<p>A flurry of work has been accomplished towards version 3.2.0. See the
details below.</p>
<p>No date has been set for the release of version 3.2.0.</p>


<h2>Interpreter Status</h2>

<p>Wow! The team has added a lot of new features to ooRexx that will be available
in version 3.2.0. There are both new classes and a general reordering of the
collection classes. There are also some new builtin functions an new language
features. Mark Miesfeld has done
some great work on ooDialog and provided some new samples and made it easier
to work with.</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The documentation of all the ooRexx classes in the reference manual has been
completely reorganized and updated. Work is continuing on this effort due to
the changing organization of the classes.</p>


<h2>Project Administration</h2>

<p>David Ashley (with approval of the RexxLA board) has taken over the project
Management role from Mark Hessling. The Rexx Labguage Association and the
ooRexx team members want to thank Mark for his past management of the ooRexx
project.</p>


<h2>Related News</h2>

<p>Work contiues on the ooRexx 3.2.0 release. This will include a
