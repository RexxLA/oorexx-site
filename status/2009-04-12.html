<h1>Open Object Rexx Project Status<br />
April - 2009</h1>
</center>

<h2>Web Site</h2>

<p>We have gotten a lot of positive feedback on the new look and feel of the web site.
We will continue to monitor the feedback in this area and make adjustments as necessary.
</p>


<h2>General</h2>

<p>The beta version of ooRexx 4.0 is available. Refer to the
<a href="/announcement.html">announcement page</a> for more details.
We hope the final release will be in June but that might change as the beta program
progresses.
</p>


<h2>Interpreter Status</h2>

<p>The team will be actively monitoring bugs opened against the ooRexx 4.0 beta. Hopefully
the number will be small as our alpha program was pretty successful in eliminating a number
of bugs.
</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The documentation for the 4.0.0 release is about complete and is included in the 4.0
beta.
.</p>


<h2>Project Administration</h2>

<p>Nothing new to report here.</p>


<h2>Related News</h2>

<p>The SourceForge Subversion incubator has a number of new entries including RexxGTK and
Mod_ooRexx.
</p>


<h2>Other</h2>
<p>As always you can subscribe to the
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/oorexx-announce">oorexx-announce</a>
mailing list to receive development updates and news like this.</p>
