<h1>Open Object Rexx Project Status<br />
August/September - 2005</h1>
</center>

<h2>Web Site</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.oorexx.org">ooRexx Web Site</a> is operational
and the ooRexx domains
oorexx.org, oorexx.net, oorexx.com and oorexx.info point there.</p>


<h2>Interpreter Status</h2>

<p>There have been over 24,000 downloads of the Version 3.0.x release since it
was made available in March. This puts the ooRexx Project in the top 3% of all
projects on the SourceForge site.</p>

<p>Rick and David are deep into the 64-bit rewrite of the code. There are lots
of improvements and we believe that the code size has been reduced. Most of the
Windows code is now compiling and linking and we have started trying to get
the Linux version ported.</p>

<p>Testing has not yet started but we should start with the Windows version
within the next month or so. The Linux version should follow soon after the
port of the code is complete.</p>

<p>If you want to help just drop a line to the
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/oorexx-devel">oorexx-devel</a>
mailing list.</p>

<p>ooRexx is going to have some up-to-date programming interfaces when all this
work is complete, plus a boat load of other goodies. Here are some of the things
Rick and David have planned.</p>

<ul>
<li>A new C++ interface for external function libraries will be available. The
amount of code to produce a library will be significantly reduced by the use
of native C++ arguments to the functions and direct access to ooRexx data
types including ooRexx objects.
<li>Classic Rexx external function libraries will still be supported.</li>
<li>Interfaces to all ooRexx objects will be provided via new C/C++ methods.
The current external function libraries supplied with ooRexx will be converted
to the new interface so that developers will have good examples to follow
when creating new function libraries or updating classic libraries.</li>
<li>If your external library uses the new interface then it will no longer
be necessary to place quotes around stem names in function calls to your
external functions in your ooRexx script.</li>
<li>A new ::PACKAGE directive will be added to aid in the loading of external
function packages. This directive will preload a function library so that the
ooRexx program does not have to explicitly load it.</li>
<li>A new keyword, EXTERNAL, will be added to the ::ROUTINE directive. This
will raise an immediate error if an external routine cannot be loaded/found.</li>
<li>The RxFuncAdd routine will be modified to return an error if the external
routine cannot be loaded/found. It will also be modified so that if the routine
is already loaded it will not return an error for the duplicate registration.</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of under-the-covers stuff is also being touched. The stream library is
being rewritten, a significant amount of code was eliminated by switching to
C++ exceptions in the kernel, David has created new build mechanisms
for the Windows and Unix code, we have switched to a sockets-based communications
mechanism for the RXAPI daemon and eliminated the shared memory interface,
Rick has eliminated
a lot of code that was not being used, the external interfaces to ooRexx have
all been updated, and much, much more.</p>

<p>If you have been looking for a way to contribute to the ooRexx Project and
you are not a C/C++ programmer, then the ooRexx test framework is your
golden opportunity. We want the test framework to have complete coverage
of the ooRexx interpreter and external function packages. So if
you have an area of expertise in ooRexx, here is your chance to contribute
unit tests to the test framework. Just drop a note to the
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/oorexx-devel">oorexx-devel</a>
mailing list and we can get you started.</li>

<p>Rony is also about to release hisOpen Office interface package for ooRexx.
This will allow ooRexx to be used as an Open Office macro language.</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Version 3.0.0 Revision 2 of the documentation is available. This
update adds indexes to all documents and cleans up a few more formating problems.
</p>


<h2>Project Administration</h2>

<p>Not much has happened in this area. No changes are expected.</p>


<h2>Other</h2>
<p>As always you can subscribe to the
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/oorexx-announce">oorexx-announce</a>
mailing list to receive development updates and news like this.</p>
