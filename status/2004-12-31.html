<h1>Open Object Rexx Project Status<br />
December - 2004</h1>
</center>

<p>We finally have the finally have all the legal problems with IBM behind us.
IBM has finally released the joint
IBM/RexxLA announcement concerning Open Object Rexx. You can view the announcement
at the <a href="http://www.rexxla.org/">RexxLA</a> web site as well as the
Open Object Rexx home page.</p>

<p>Here is the final status for items received from IBM</p>

<ol>
<li>Complete source code for the Object Rexx interpreter for Windows, Linux, AIX
and Solaris. The code we were given does not contain all the materials necessary
to build an OS/2 interpreter.</li>
<li>Source code for the external function libraries rexxutil, rxsock, oodialog,
rxmath and some smaller libraries.</li>
<li>Documentation in PDF and HTML format.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is the final status for items not received from IBM</p>

<ol>
<li>The Windows development environment (Workbench) was not turned over to RexxLA
due to legal issues with the development libraries used to create this
application.</li>
<li>Rxftp external function library. There was a legal problem with this library
because IBM used code that is under a non-disclosure agreement. An alpha
replacement for RxFtp in the form of an ORexx class library which invokes the
RxSock external function library to communicate with the target FTP server is
available for review. Contact David Ashley at wdashley@sourceforge.net if you
would like a copy for your review.
</ol>

<p>We have made some progress in transitioning the build process to the
auto tools (autoconf, libtool, etc). We hit a snag with the latest GCC
compiler because it uses strict C++ rules as opposed to the loose rules used
by Visual C++ and older GCC versions. A lot of the code will have to be
updated in order for it to compile correctly without warnings. This is going
to take longer to finish than anticipated.</p>

<p>We are finally getting ourselves organized. We should have most organizational
issues resolved by the end of January including a project charter and a board
of directors in place. We are working closely with the RexxLA board of directors
to make everything official.</p>

<p>The code for Open Object Rexx should appear on the SourceForge CVS
repository soon. We need to tweak a few more items before we feel comforatable
letting the public see our work but we promise it will be worth the wait.
There will probably be multiple CVS modules involved but we will document them.
</p>

<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/oorexx-announce">oorexx-announce</a>
mailing list to receive development updates and news like this.</p>
