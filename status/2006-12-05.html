<h1>Open Object Rexx Project Status<br />
December - 2006</h1>
</center>

<h2>Web Site</h2>
<p>As of Dec 5 there had been 10680 visitors to the ooRexx website. This averages
to 137 visitors per day.</p>


<h2>General</h2>
<p>As of November 19 Open Object Rexx 3.1.1 is generally available.
We have received a large number of downloads for ooRexx and are very pleased
with the reception by the community.</p>

<p>We added some new platforms for ooRexx with the 3.1.1 release including the
Mac. Many thanks to Rene Jansen for all his work putting the Mac release
together. Thanks go to Rainer Tammer also for his work on the AIX release.</p>


<h2>Interpreter Status</h2>

<p>Many thanks to Mark Miesfeld for fixing numerous bugs in the Windows version
of ooRexx. All of his fixes were included in the 3.1.1 release. This should fix
most of the outstanding issues with the Windows version of ooRexx.</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Version 3.1.1 Revision 4 of the documentation is available. This
update corresponds to the ooRexx 3.1.1 release.</p>


<h2>Project Administration</h2>

<p>David Ashley will be taking on more project administrative tasks from Mark
Hessling. Mark is really busy with the RexxLA RICE project.</p>


<h2>Related News</h2>

<p>Rony's BSF4Rexx package was included in the 3.1.1 Mac version of ooRexx. If
the feedback on this is positive we may merge BSF4Rexx into all platforms
supported by ooRexx.</p>
