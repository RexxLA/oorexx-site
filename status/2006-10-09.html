<h1>Open Object Rexx Project Status<br />
October - 2006</h1>
</center>

<h2>Web Site</h2>
<p>We added a visitor counter to the <a href="http://www.oorexx.org/">ooRexx Web Site</a>.
This will help us to determine the visibility of Open Object Rexx on the Internet.</p>


<h2>General</h2>
<p>Open Object Rexx 3.1 is now generally available.
We have received a large number of downloads for ooRexx and are very pleased
with the reception by the community.</p>

<h2>Interpreter Status</h2>

<p>A few bugs in the Windows
OLE support have been discovered and fixed. We are determining how and when to
release an updated version.</p>

<p>The Subversion repository has been set up. It
will be used to house the source for the 4.0 version of
ooRexx. The CVS repository will continue to house the 3.x versions.</p>

<p>If you want to help just drop a line to the
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/oorexx-devel">oorexx-devel</a>
mailing list.</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Version 3.1.0 of the documentation is available. This
update corresponds to the ooRexx 3.1 release.</p>


<h2>Project Administration</h2>

<p>The ooRexx Development Team added a new member. Please welcome Mark Miesfeld
to the team. Mark has contributed a number of fixes and enhancements to the
Windows OLE support and will also be working on the Windows scripting support.
Welcome Mark!</p>
