<h1>Open Object Rexx Project Status<br />
July - 2008</h1>
</center>

<h2>Web Site</h2>
<p>As you can see the web site has a brand new look and feel. This should
address some of the issues that have been raised concerning this issue
as well as supplying the vision impaired some tools for using the site
more effectively.</p>


<h2>General</h2>

<p>We are currently debugging the future 4.0.0 release of ooRexx. The Windows
build is fairly stable but the Linux build still needs some work. We do not
expect to release 4.0 before the end of 2008 as there are so many changes that
need to be tested it will require an extensive debugging and testing period.</p>


<h2>Interpreter Status</h2>

<p>The 3.2.0 interpreter has now been out for a while and looks to be our best
release so far.</p>
<p>The 4.0.0 interpreter is still under heavy development. It will have a host
of new features and will require an extensive testing period.</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The documentation for the 4.0.0 release is still under development. It will
require some time to document all the new features, especially the C++ API to
the interpreter. The new RexxGTK package will also need some time to document.</p>


<h2>Project Administration</h2>

<p>Terry Constant has left the team due to time constraints.</p>


<h2>Related News</h2>

<p>A new external function library is under development. It is currently named
RexxGTK and will provide a nice mechanism for accessing the GTK graphics 
subsystem on Linux and, with the proper DLLs loaded, on Windows. ooDialog
will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future but the furure as
the team sees it is with the RexxGTK library.</p>
