               <b>Charter of the Open Object Rexx Project</b>
				</div>	

            <p>
               This Charter defines the purpose, mission, and organization of the Open Object Rexx open source development project.
            </p>
            <div class="centered">
               <b><i>This charter was approved by the RexxLA Board on Monday 17th April 2005</i></b>
            </div>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
               Open Object Rexx (ooRexx) is a platform-independent application and scripting development tool, originally developed and marketed by IBM&reg; as "Object REXX".
               In 2004, IBM contributed the source code of Object REXX for Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;, IBM&reg; AIX&reg;, Linux&reg;, and SUN Solaris&reg; to
               <a href="http://www.rexxla.org/">The Rexx Language Association</a>
               (RexxLA) to be made available under the
               <a href="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/CPLv1.0.htm">Common Public License</a>
               (CPL) V1.0.
               The RexxLA
               <a href="http://www.oorexx.org/">Open Object Rexx Project</a>
               (Project) was established to provide the source code to Open Object Rexx on an Internet-accessible code repository, freely available to all.
            </p>
            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <ol>
               <li>
                  To create, maintain, enhance, and support Open Object Rexx language processors and documentation.
               </li>
               <li>
                  To respond promptly with corrective service to legitimately reported defects.
               </li>
               <li>
                  To maintain the conformance of Open Object Rexx to the applicable open standards and licenses and to encourage conforming extensions of the language.
               </li>
               <li>
                  To promote Open Object Rexx as a development tool for programmers and to encourage the adoption of Open Object Rexx in open source and proprietary software and operating systems.
               </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Organization</h2>
            <p>
               The ooRexx project is governed by the RexxLA Board of Directors (Board) which appoints the Development Team and guides the Project mission.
               The Development Team consists of volunteers who are representatives of the Rexx community willing and able to commit time and energy to fulfilling the Project mission.
            </p>
            <h3> Membership </h3>
            <p>
               The ooRexx Project is a meritocracy - the more one does to advance the mission, the more one will be allowed to do.
               The <i>merit stages</i> within the ooRexx project are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  A <b>User</b> is anyone who uses ooRexx.
                  User participation in the Project may be <i>active</i> (responds to mailing list questions, reports bugs/feature requests) or <i>passive</i> (simply uses ooRexx).
               </li>
               <li>
                  A <b>Developer</b> is an <i>active User</i> who contributes patches or enhancements to the code or documentation, but does NOT have write access to the code repository.
               </li>
               <li>
                  A <b>Committer</b> is a <i>Developer</i> who has write access to the code repository, and voting rights on Project issues.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Promotion</h4>
            <p>
               <i>Developers</i> who submit frequent and valuable contributions to the Project may be promoted to <i>Committer</i>.
               <i>Committers</i> have write access to the Project code repository and voting rights allowing them to directly affect the state of the Project.
               In order for a <i>Developer</i> to become a <i>Committer</i>, another <i>Committer</i> must nominate the <i>Developer</i>.
               (A <i>Developer</i> may ask to be nominated.)
               If there are at least three positive votes and no negative votes, the <i>Developer</i> is recommended to the Board.
               If the Board approves the promotion, write access to the Project code repository is granted and the <i>Developer</i> is added to the Development Team Mailing List.
               Becoming a <i>Committer</i> is a privilege that is earned by showing discipline and good judgement.
               It is a responsibility that should be neither given nor taken lightly.
            </p>
            <h4>Demotion</h4>
            <p>
               <i>Committers</i> may become unproductive for various reasons.
               The orderly functioning of the Project relies on active <i>Committers</i> who participate constructively in discussions, complete assigned tasks, and vote, in a timely manner.
               An unproductive <i>Committer</i> may be demoted by the Board upon the recommendation of a majority of the other <i>Committers</i>.
               The <i>Project Manager</i> is authorized by the Board to immediately revoke the status of any <i>Committer</i> if necessary to maintain the orderly functioning of the Project.
               The <i>Project Manager</i> shall submit a justification of an immediate revocation within 48 hours of a request for same from the Board.
            </p>
            <h4>Voting</h4>
            <p>
               Each member of the Development Team is granted one vote which must be one of the following responses: +1 (Yes), -1 (No), 0 (Abstain).
               <i>Committers</i> are required to track, discuss, and vote on relevant issues affecting the Project.
               The voting process is conducted on the Development Team Mailing List and will specify the resolution in question and a deadline at which the voting concludes.
               For a resolution to pass, valid votes must be received from a majority of the members of the Development Team, and the sum of all valid votes must be positive (&gt;0).
               All "No" votes must provide, before the voting deadline, an explanation for the "No" vote, otherwise that vote will be invalid.
               Upon the expiry of the deadline, all unreceived votes will be invalid.
               The voting process concludes at the deadline or once no further votes can change the outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
               For example, a resolution with a 48 hour deadline is submitted to all five members of the Development Team:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  three "Yes" votes arrive within 24 hours: voting concludes and the resolution passes.
               </li>
               <li>
                  after 48 hours, only two valid votes are received: voting concludes and the resolution fails.
               </li>
               <li>
                  after 48 hours, the sum of all valid votes is zero (0): voting concludes and the resolution fails.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
            <h4>RexxLA Board</h4>

               Project Mission and Organization, including determining the membership of
               the Development Team.
            </p>
            <h4>Development Team</h4>
            <p>
               The day-to-day operation of the project is effected by the Development Team.

            <p>
               The Open Object Rexx source code is distributed under the Common Public License V1.0.
               All contributions of source code or documentation, no matter the size, must adhere strictly to the CPL v1.0.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <b>It is the responsibility of the contributor to ensure that the source distribution license is compatible with CPL v1.0</b>

            <p>
            The RexxLA Board may, from time to time, make modifications to this Charter.
            A proposed modification will be submitted to the Board and the Developer Mailing List for review and comment.
            All proposed changes to the Project Charter will be posted on the Open Object Rexx Project website for community discussion.
            After a sufficient time for comments, the President of RexxLA will call for a vote by the Board on the proposed Charter modification.
            A majority vote in favor of the proposal is necessary for the modification to be adopted.
