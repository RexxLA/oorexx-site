# oorexx-site
The RexxLA ooRexx website is versioned in this repository. For a number of years the Open Object Rexx language did have an out-of-date and not very informative website. This is being replaced by something that needs to convey some information on the implementation, a documentation, community, download and news site. Here you can find the start of it.
